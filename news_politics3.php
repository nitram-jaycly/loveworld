                        The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has postponed the elections which were long scheduled to take place today 
                        the 16th of February 2019 and are said to be postponed to February 23rd.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        INEC chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, while briefing the media at the commission’s headquarters, announced that, 
                        the continuation of the elections which were scheduled for today, the 16th of February, 2019, was no longer possible. 
                        According to the INEC chairman, following a careful review of the implementation of its logistics and operational plan, 
                        and the determination to conduct free, fair, and credible elections, the commission came to the conclusion that, 
                        proceeding with the elections as scheduled was no longer practicable. He therefore announced the presidential and National
                        Assembly elections to have been moved to February 23, 2019.
