                        When we talk about worship, there’re those who don’t understand what it is. They wonder, “Who do you worship?” “Why do you worship?” 
                        “What are the benefits of worship?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Worship is the recognition and appreciation of the goodness, blessings, kindness and righteousness of God. It’s the recognition, 
                        appreciation or confession of His character. For example, when you give thanks to God and say, “Lord, you’re good; you’re kind; 
                        you’ve blessed me; you’re righteous,” etc., you’re defining, recognizing, and appreciating His character.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        God likes it when you worship Him like that because it shows who He is in your life; it separates Him from everyone else and from everything else. 
                        When you thank Him for His goodness, provisions, blessings, and all the wonderful things He’s given you, and done for you, you’re attributing those 
                        beautiful works to Him. The necessary result is that He’ll do more in your life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, worship brings to us a greater revelation of God. This is why we worship God and not men, angels or things. 
                        Neither men nor angels have the capacity or ability to reveal themselves beyond what they themselves can perceive. 
                        You can’t grow spiritually from knowing an angel or another human being; no human can reflect you to you, 
                        because every human being is unique to himself. But in fellowship, God reveals Himself to you, and in that process, 
                        He reveals you to you, and also reveals your future, your life, your personality, your value and then His purpose for your life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s why when you study the Bible and read of men and women who encountered God, they all had a divine revelation of God’s purpose for their lives, 
                        an understanding of the future that God was leading them into, and a revelation of God Himself. Thus, worship for us is something much more than a form, 
                        a ritual or mere religious activity. When we worship God, there’s true recognition, a true perception, and real encounter with Deity.
