                        In July 2018 South Africa unveiled a regulatory charter for its mining industry. Presented by Resources Minister, Gwede Mantashe, 
                        the third version of the charter requires miners to provide their local communities and employees with a free 10 percent stake of 
                        their firms. The charter raises the level of black ownership as expected to 30 percent from 26 percent, with 20 percent for black 
                        business interests and 5 percent each for communities and employees. Some companies may have a challenge in implement this, however 
                        unions say the move is needed to secure social peace. Loveworld News reporter Innocent Semosa was at the 2019 Mining Indaba which 
                        was held at the Cape Town International Convention Center and on a quest for information Innocent traveled to Mpumalanga province 
                        and spoke to to some community members in Mpumalanga province who raises concerns about small scale mining licenses, and filed this 
                        report.
