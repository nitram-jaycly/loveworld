                        As a child of God, it matters who you’re listening to. The opening scripture shows that God is concerned about who you listen to because your life is 
                        the expression of all you’ve built into you; friends you’ve been listening to, those who’ve been advising you, sharing with you and talking with you. 
                        You can’t be different from the information you’ve accumulated in your spirit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you grow in your Christian walk, learn to listen to godly men and women whose lifestyle is from heaven. “Remember those who rule over you, who have 
                        spoken the word of God to you, whose faith follow, considering the outcome of their conduct” (Hebrews 13:7). You can’t watch every television programme, 
                        listen to all kinds of songs, or read every newspaper and magazine out there. This is so important, because it’s only a matter of time before what you’ve 
                        become as a result of what you’ve been ingesting, begins to show up in your attitude, your actions, your words, your results, and your life as a whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Choose today to listen to those who truly know the Lord, not to murmurers and complainers who are ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
                    </p>
