                        Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa has cut short his visit to Europe to return to his embattled country, it emerged yesterday.

                        Earlier on Sunday, the Democratic Alliance threatened to approach the International Criminal Court (ICC) to consider a preliminary 
                        investigation into human rights violations in Zimbabwe. The DA urged President Cyril Ramaphosa to re-consider his Quiet Diplomacy 
                        2.0 on Zimbabwe and intervene directly to stop the ongoing human rights violations by President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government”, 
                        DA spokesman Stevens Mokgalapa said in a statement. The DA strongly believed that the current human rights crisis in Zimbabwe was 
                        of sufficient gravity to warrant an ICC investigation, because, according to the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, at least 12 people 
                        had been killed, 78 shot at, and 240 faced “assault, torture, inhumane, and degrading treatment”.
