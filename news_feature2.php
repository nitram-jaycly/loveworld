                        The political crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo deepened this past Sunday when the Constitutional Court confirmed the win of Felix 
                        Tshisekedi, rejecting claims of fraud, and runner-up Martin Fayulu promptly declared himself the country’s “only legitimate president”.

                    <p>
                        Fayulu’s supporters have alleged an extraordinary backroom deal between outgoing President Joseph Kabila to rig the vote in favour of the opposition 
                        after the ruling party’s candidate did so poorly that a Plan B was needed. Neither side has acknowledged the accusations. The court, however, said 
                        Fayulu offered no proof to back his assertions that he had won easily based on leaked data attributed to the electoral commission. Following the court 
                        ruling, the African Union postponed a visit by a high-level delegation to Kinshasa that had been scheduled for Monday to discuss the crisis. The bloc 
                        has previously expressed “serious concerns” over the vote and called for the results to be delayed.
