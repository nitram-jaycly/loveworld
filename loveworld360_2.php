                        I love to define the “fight of faith” as “the unleashing of your faith on the rebellious circumstances of life; to compel changes to correspond with your 
                        stubborn faith proclamations.” I chose to use the word “unleash” to communicate the strength of the definition. To “unleash” means to “release or vent”; 
                        it means to “turn loose or free from restraint”; “to release from a leash” much in the same way as a guard dog is released from its leash to pursue a criminal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So the way and manner to apply your faith to the contrary situations you face isn’t passive or mild; you unleash it, and that connotes some form of divine aggression! 
                        The Bible says: “Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life” (1 Timothy 6:12).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fight of faith is when you vent or turn your faith loose to run rampage against the negative situations of life! When sickness attacks your body, 
                        for example, you unleash your faith to the maximum! That’s the time to maintain your confessions of health and healing, 
                        irrespective of the symptoms you may be feeling. Learn to vocalize your faith, irrespective and independent of the obvious contrary circumstances. 
                        This is why you must consciously study and meditate on the word of God. That’s the way your faith is increased.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Matthew 17:20 says, “For verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; 
                        and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.” No matter how rebellious the circumstance are, they can never withstand the unleashing of 
                        your stubborn faith. This is why you must study and meditate on the word of God consciously for that’s the way your faith is increased. When your faith 
                        reservoir is high, it’ll be easy to pull out the necessary confessions that’ll force rebellious circumstance to comply with your faith’s proclamations.
