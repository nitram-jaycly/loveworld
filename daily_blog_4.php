                        The Second Day of the LoveWorld Festival of Music and Arts started up with a beautiful Carnival procession alongside the beautiful sunny weather. 
                        The carnival procession showcasing different zones and ministry outreaches were ‘beyond imagination,’ with the Man of God himself dressed in a 
                        colorful costume-mask. Several Senior Pastors were also seen donning impressive and decorative attires.

                    <p>
                        According to Pastor Chris’ word, there was perfect weather, contrary to thunderstorm forecasts. The weather forecast for the day predicted 
                        thunderstorms in the region, but at the previous night’s concert, the man of God, Pastor Chris declared that we would have and enjoy a beautiful 
                        concert today. Several came to the Nasrec Expo Center prepared for rain, it was a perfect sunny weather at the LFMA 2015 Day II.

                        The carnival float at the LFMA 2015 was full of amazing surprises for everyone present. The extravagant splendor on display showed that, indeed, 
                        the Christian has nothing to desire in the world, as we have been given the very best in the ‘zoe-life’ for a fulfilling and exciting experience 
                        here on earth and after.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From gymnasts to mummers, living statues and stilt walkers, the float was replete with talent, performing to godly and inspiring music. Even more 
                        exciting for the audience were several Zonal Pastors, Pastor Ose Oyakhilome, Pastor Biodun Lawal, Pastor Karen Victor and more, leading their team 
                        marches.

                        The LFMA indoor auditorium was a place of excitement and inspiration for many at the program, since it began. Holding every morning into afternoon, 
                        various BLW stars and upcoming acts seized a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to minister in their unique gifts to a global audience.

                        Everyone at the Nasrec Expo Center from April 24 to 26 was constantly bombarded with the motivation to be and do all that they were purposed for. 
                        From enlightening talks with LMM all-stars such as Sinach, Ada, Isaiah Samson, CSO, Chris Shalom and more, to discussions with painters, sculptors 
                        and other such artists, everyone left feeling incited to greatness after each session.

                        LFMA 2015 attendees were treated to electrifying performances at Outdoor Concert. The audience were awed by the spectacles they beheld. Beginning 
                        with T-Sharp’s electrifying rendition of the BLW Anthem, it was a night of top-class excellence in artistry.

                        Worship ministers, such as Eben, Joe Praize, PU, and several others took the audience to heights of celestial bliss like they have never experienced 
                        in worship before. Various dance acts, drama and rap ministrations gave everyone something to shout about, while comedic acts had the auditorium 
                        roaring in kingly laughter.
