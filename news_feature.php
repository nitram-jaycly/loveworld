                        Just two years ago, on the heels of Donald Trump’s election, the European Union was playing up China’s potential as a partner 
                        that could help preserve the global order. But a new strategy paper from the European Commission, released on Tuesday, moves 
                        to recalibrate the EU’s approach toward China, calling it an “economic competitor” and a “systemic rival.” The paper, which 
                        comes ahead of a planned series of high-level meetings between European and Chinese leaders, notes Beijing’s failure to open 
                        its markets, describes its treatment of European companies as unfair, and claims that its foreign investment practices undermine 
                        the rule of law and human rights. It also lays out a number of steps the EU and its member states can take to strengthen cooperation 
                        in areas of agreement with China, while working toward a “more balanced and reciprocal economic relationship.” These include pressuring 
                        Beijing to end forced technology transfers and making European procurement contracts for Chinese companies dependent on reciprocal access 
                        to China’s procurement market. In addition, the paper recommends a system to block aggressive Chinese trade tactics such as takeovers of 
                        European interests by state-subsidized firms—especially in sensitive sectors like technology. Ashley Feng and Sagatom Saha touched on this 
                        issue in a briefing for WPR last month, arguing that the EU should adopt France’s screening method for Chinese investment.

                        As the EU seeks to confront China’s global assertiveness, it will need to coordinate among its member states, many of which have deepened 
                        ties with China in recent years. Italy is on the verge of becoming the first Group of Seven country to endorse China’s Belt and Road Initiative 
                        despite criticisms from many other Western countries that Chinese infrastructure investments amount to “debt-trap diplomacy.” EU member states 
                        are also divided on how to approach investments in their new 5G networks by Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.

                        Brussels’ ability to act on its strategy paper may soon come into focus. EU foreign ministers are scheduled to meet with their 
                        Chinese counterparts next week, and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang will represent China at its annual summit meeting with the EU, 
                        to be held in Brussels on April 9. Chinese President Xi Jinping is also expected to visit a number of European countries in the 
                        coming weeks.

                        Top Reads on China. A talent drain in China’s bureaucracy?: “For centuries, getting a job as a government bureaucrat has been the 
                        path to power and relative wealth in China,” write Dandan Li and Peter Martin of Bloomberg News. But Xi has ruthlessly consolidated 
                        power since 2012, a process that has taken a toll on rank-and-file officials. Li and Martin interviewed eight current and former 
                        Chinese officials in ministries and provincial governments, many of whom described feeling burned-out and tired of having their 
                        loyalty questioned. Others complained about rising living costs and a widening pay gap between the public and private sectors.

                        A 29-year-old civil servant in a provincial capital is rethinking his career as housing prices soar beyond what he can hope to afford 
                        on his $522 monthly salary. And another official quit to join a private company after 10 years of service, disillusioned by increasing 
                        scrutiny from the party’s disciplinary watchdog, which combs party officials’ reports looking for “malpractice” or “inaction.”China’s 
                        “new natalism”: China’s aging population and rapidly shrinking labor force have stoked calls from within the Communist Party to “liberate 
                        fertility.” Writing in Foreign Policy, Shanghai-based writer Frankie Huang warns of a new top-down push for more children that will “mirror 
                        the coercion of the one-child policy” rather than offering incentives for motherhood.

                        Perks such as legal protection for mothers at the workplace, extended maternity and paternity leave, and child care subsidies enjoyed by 
                        mothers in countries such as Sweden and Japan would offer women too much freedom and obscure the notion that motherhood isn’t a choice, 
                        but a duty. Under Xi Jinping’s patriarchal rule, obedient daughters must know their place.Xi’s successes are becoming liabilities: Xi’s 
                        achievements during his first term as China’s president are undeniable, yet the mood in Beijing is “far from victorious,” writes Elizabeth 
                        C. Economy, director for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. She argues that a slowing economy, social discontent and rising 
                        suspicion of Chinese enterprises overseas are all problems of Xi’s own making, but that he still has time to make necessary adjustments.

                        With the baton in Xi’s hand, the Chinese government has expanded its reach and influence at home and abroad. Yet the negative consequences of Xi’s 
                        approach—local government paralysis, a declining birthrate, and international opposition, among others—have begun to hold China back from the finish 
                        line. Xi needs to course correct—or perhaps pass the baton to the next runner.In the News This Week Domestic politics: China grounded Boeing 737 Max
