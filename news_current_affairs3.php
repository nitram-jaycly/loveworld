                        Nearly 50 people were charged this week as part of a government crackdown on alleged instigators of ethnic violence in the Somali region. 
                        The accused include Abdi Mohammed Omer, the former president of the region. The Somali region has been a hotbed of ethnic violence that, 
                        could jeopardize Prime Minister Abiy Ahmedâ€™s ability to implement his ambitious reform agenda.
