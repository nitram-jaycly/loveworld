                        Consider a classroom of students studying the same course. Among them, some are reading very hard, so they don’t fail the exams. Perhaps they had failed in some previous exams. 
                        Then you have these other students who are reading very hard as well, because they want to have excellent grades. They want to win a prize. Though all these students are reading hard, 
                        their motivations are different. And this is how it is in life. That someone is working so hard doesn’t mean he’s in the right direction. It all depends on what his inspiration is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should always be inspired by the dream of success, and not the fear of failure. Refuse to be haunted by past mistakes; rather, be challenged by the opportunity of a greater future. 
                        Many whine and grumble about their past, sorrowing about their past, wondering what to do about their past, instead of looking at the future with the hope and the opportunities it 
                        presents for greater success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Irrespective of the challenges or shortcomings experienced in the past, be inspired by the joy of winning. See the bright and glorious future ahead. Always have this mind-set. 
                        Paul said, “…this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize…” 
                        Don’t think failure. Don’t think defeat. Launch out into the year with the power of the Spirit, seeing only victories and endless possibilities. You’re born to win; and the 
                        Lord is leading you on a victory parade. Forget the past; take a hold of your future, and win!
